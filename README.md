# QuizGame
This JS program displays questions from an array and then it displays its multiple choices in a random fashion.

This project is in its first step. I plan to make it a little more engaging by keeping track of score and displaying it at the end. I will also create an app to so that the user can input their own questions and get the code back so that it can be used in another website.

For more information about the code itself please refer to the embedded comments.
